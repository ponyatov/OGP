ok, I\'m now working on making English version of the demo knowledge base hosted
at http://kbase.pythonanywhere.com/

The idea is about implementing a graph-like data structure atop of Flask instance
and some script engine, which will organize independent text elements into the
non-linear manual.

The first draft of the manual is still provided in the Jupyter .ipynb notebook as
it requires executable Python scripts included for student exercises:
